      <p>The team showcased findings from two research projects: <strong>VR to Support Trauma Therapy in Ukraine: Clinician Feedback on Four BRAVEMIND Scenarios</strong> and <strong>Testing a Combat Scenario of BRAVEMIND Ukraine: A Virtual Reality Approach to Wartime Trauma.</strong> Both sparked meaningful conversations and drew enthusiastic responses from attendees.</p>
      <p>Their poster presentations were met with great interest and appreciation, highlighting the relevance and impact of their work in the evolving field of virtual reality and trauma therapy. The conference provided a dynamic platform not only for sharing insights but also for engaging with leading minds in the discipline.</p>
      <p>One of the highlights of the trip was the chance to learn directly from a widely recognized researcher, Ad de Jongh. Their meeting with him offered invaluable perspectives and inspired new directions for future research within the group.</p>
      <p>The experience in Prague was more than just academicâ€”it was a chance to connect, collaborate, and grow. The VR research group returned energized and motivated, ready to build on the momentum of their successful research findings and continue pushing the boundaries of their work.</p>
